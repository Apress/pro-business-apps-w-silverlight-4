This solution implements the following concepts discussed in Chapter 10:

Advanced XAML
-------------
- Defining constants in XAML
- Using a pre-defined trigger and an action
- Creating and using a custom trigger and a custom action
- Creating and using a custom behavior
- Using design-time sample data

Advanced Data Binding
---------------------
- Binding to objects in a PagedCollectionView
- Binding to objects in a CollectionViewSource
- Creating and using a value converter
- Defining and using a custom consolidated namespace (http://schemas.yourbusinessurl.com/XAML)

NOTE: The entity model uses the AdventureWorks2008 database, which you can download
from http://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com.  You will need to configure the
connection string (named 'AdventureWorks2008Entities') in the App.Config file
to point towards your database once you've installed it.
