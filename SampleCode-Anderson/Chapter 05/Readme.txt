Chapter05Sample
---------------

The Chapter05Sample solution demonstrates a simple solution structure of a Silverlight
and a Web project directly connected via RIA Services.  You will find an entity model defined 
in the Chapter05Sample.Web project, from which the services in the same project
will serve data up (although the client side code/XAML to consume this service has
not yet been implemented).


AdventureWorksLOB
-----------------
The AdventureWorksLOB solution demonstrates implementing a middle tier, using RIA 
Services Class Library projects.  You will find an entity model defined in the 
AdventureWorksMiddleTier.Web project, from which the services in the same project
will serve data up (although the client side code/XAML to consume this service has
not yet been implemented).
