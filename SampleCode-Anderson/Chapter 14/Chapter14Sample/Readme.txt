This solution demonstrates the following concepts from Chapter 14:

- Determining whether running inside or outside the browser
- Determining installation status
- Installing the application programmatically
- Toast notifications
- Checking for updates*
- Detecting network connection availability
- Using isolated storage
- Drag/drop target
- COM interaction
- Custom chrome, and enabling a borderless window to be moved/resized


* Checking for updates will work when running from localhost, but you will need
  to sign your XAP (as described in chapter 15) for it to update from other sources
