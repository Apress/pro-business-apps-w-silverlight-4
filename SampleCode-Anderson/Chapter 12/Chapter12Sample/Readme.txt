This solution demonstrates the MVVM design pattern.  A very simple MVVM
"framework" can be found in the SimpleMVVM folder, which provides the base
functionality required.

NOTE: The entity model uses the AdventureWorks2008 database, which you can download
from http://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com.  You will need to configure the
connection string (named 'AdventureWorks2008Entities') in the App.Config file
to point towards your database once you've installed it.
